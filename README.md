**Your test for coronavirus(joke)**

I want to present you a CoronaAntivirus on Python!

```
You need python **3+**
To run this you need to run 
py antivirus.py
```
It is easily and sorry for my english it is really bad.

If you have a linux or windows don't worry this script automatically choose command to clear console.

Bye!
